\chapter{Background}

Recent advances in legged locomotion have largely focused on either
implicit gait-based policies or perception-driven foothold selection
modules. However, these approaches often trade off between agility,
expressiveness, and computational cost. In contrast to gaited methods
that impose rhythmic structure, non-gaited planning allows for more
versatile, terrain-adaptive behaviorsâ€”but typically at the expense of
increased planning complexity. Bridging this gap, our proposed
approach draws on greedy methods for their computational efficiency
and on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for terrain-aware
generalization, aiming to achieve dynamic, non-gaited footstep
planning in real time. This section reviews the foundations upon
which our approach builds: learning-based locomotion strategies,
footstep planners, greedy selection mechanisms, and foothold
classification techniques. Each informs a different aspect of our
planner's design and situates our method within the broader landscape
of quadruped control.
