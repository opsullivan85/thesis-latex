\chapter{Background}
\label{chap:background}

Recent advances in legged locomotion have largely focused on either
optimization-based motion planning or learning-based policy generation.
The former, categorized as traditional control approaches,
offers formal guarantees but faces significant computational hurdles
when dealing with dynamic, non-gaited footstep selection. The latter,
end-to-end neural networks, provides adaptability and implicitly
solves the discrete contact problem, but lacks control theory guarantees
and interpretability.

The most promising efforts to bridge this gap are hybrid methods,
which integrate learning modules within model-based frameworks. Our
proposed approach seeks to enhance this hybrid strategy by developing a
computationally efficient, non-gaited footstep planner. This chapter
reviews the foundations upon which our method builds: the limitations of
traditional control and end-to-end Neural Networks, and the
state-of-the-art in hybrid methods, including learned gait policies and
explicit footstep planners. This review establishes the necessity of
our novel hybrid architecture.
