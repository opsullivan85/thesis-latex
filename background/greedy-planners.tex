\section{Greedy and Heuristic Footstep Planners}

\begin{outline}
  Explore the use of greedy and heuristic methods in locomotion,
  referencing works like those by Gao et al. and Zucker et al.
  Explain their benefits (computational efficiency) and how your work
  extends them.
\end{outline}

Greedy planners offer computationally efficient alternatives to
exhaustive search, often prioritizing goal-directed heuristics or
local stability metrics. Gao et al. \cite{gao_global_2024} propose
GH-QP, a greedy-heuristic hybrid that incorporates expected robot
speed into a footstep planning heuristic, though it is limited to
bipedal systems and lacks support for dynamic footstep plans. Zucker
et al. \cite{zucker_optimization_2011} use A* with a learned terrain
cost and Dubins car heuristic for footstep planning, enabling
effective search in SE(2) but restricted to static, gated locomotion.
Kalakrishnan et al. \cite{kalakrishnan_learning_2012} combine greedy
terrain-cost search with a coarse-to-fine pose optimization pipeline,
but rely on fixed gait patterns and struggle with highly constrained
environments. While these works demonstrate the potential of greedy
methods, none support both dynamically unstable and non-gaited
footstep generation. Notably, some prior methods already
discussed—such as ContactNet \cite{bratta_contactnet_2024}, DeepLoco
\cite{peng_deeploco_2017}, and Villarreal et al.
\cite{villarreal_fast_2019}—also incorporate greedy elements in their pipelines.
