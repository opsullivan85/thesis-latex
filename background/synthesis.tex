\section{Synthesis}
\label{sec:background-synthesis}

The analysis of current hybrid methods reveals a persistent need for
an approach that can combine the expressiveness and terrain
generalization of learned foothold evaluation with the computational
efficiency of fast, greedy planning to achieve real-time, non-gaited,
dynamically stable footstep generation. This gap---the need for a
system that moves beyond fixed gaits and pre-defined sequential leg
movements---forms the basis of our proposed approach.
