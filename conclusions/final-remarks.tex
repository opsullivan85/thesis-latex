This thesis set out to explore whether a hybrid control pipeline,
combining a greedy neural network-based planner with a model-based
controller, could generate dynamic and acyclic gaits for quadruped
locomotion. Through the design, training, and evaluation of
GaitNet, this work demonstrated that such an approach is not
only feasible but can yield robust and adaptive locomotion behaviors
in challenging simulated environments. The results validate the
central hypothesis that hybrid architectures can bridge the gap
between the adaptability of learning-based methods and the
reliability of model-based control.

Beyond performance metrics, the findings carry broader implications
for the design of locomotion systems. The success of the greedy
planning strategy highlights the potential of lightweight,
inference-efficient neural networks for real-time decision-making in
high-dimensional control problems.

Equally important are the insights into learning dynamics and
representation. The discovery that removing pre-computed cost terms
improves performance suggests that hybrid controllers should not
merely layer learned modules on top of existing heuristics, but
rather allow networks to develop their own internal representations
of value and risk through exploration. As such, the future of legged
locomotion control may depend less on handcrafted structure and more
on architectures that enable learned coordination within well-defined
safety boundaries.

In closing, this work contributes to the growing evidence that
data-driven methods can coexist effectively with analytical control
frameworks, each compensating for the other's weaknesses.
GaitNet provides a concrete example of how this integration
can produce dynamic, adaptive, and interpretable motion
strategies\textemdash paving the way for future quadruped systems
capable of operating reliably in unstructured, real-world
environments. Continued efforts toward real-hardware validation,
richer environments, and predictive planning will further advance the
vision of truly agile, autonomous legged locomotion.
