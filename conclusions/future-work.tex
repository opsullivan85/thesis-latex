\section{Future Work}

\begin{outline}
  Suggest potential avenues for future research, such as extending
  the method to real-world deployment, integrating different sensor
  modalities, or exploring multi-robot collaboration.
\end{outline}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Real-World Deployment

  \item Swing re-planning
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Currently, GaitNet doesn't re-plan at all during swings.
      \item This would be trivial to add to GaitNet, but would require
        a more robust low level controller.
    \end{itemize}

  \item Explore different action sampling methods
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Currently we are using ContactNet to approximate the
        value of foot positions, but other methods could be explored.
    \end{itemize}

  \item Long horizon planning
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Currently GaitNet is only trained to optimize actions
        at a single point in time.
      \item The current implementation causes issues with the MPC
        not accurately knowing the future contact state. It looks
        like after every swing the robot will return to a nominal stance.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
