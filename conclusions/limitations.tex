\section{Limitations}

\begin{outline}
  Acknowledge the limitations of your approach.
\end{outline}

\begin{itemize}
  \item only proven in simulation
  \item no-lookahead limits performance at higher speeds
  \item currently appears to be limited by accuracy of footstep placements
    by low level controller
  \item GaitNet limited by the effectiveness of the underlying action
    candidate sampling method.
\end{itemize}
