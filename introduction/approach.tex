\section{Approach}
\label{sec:introduction-approach}

The proposed approach employs a modified implementation of
ContactNet's architecture, adapted specifically to generate footstep
candidates. These candidates will be evaluated and ranked by our
novel planner, \textit{GaitNet}, which selects the most appropriate
action at each time step. By integrating this planner within a
traditional control framework, we aim to harness the advantages of
both learning-based and model-based methods, yielding a robust and
adaptable quadruped locomotion system.
