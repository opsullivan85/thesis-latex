\section{Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Development of a novel footstep planner utilizing greedy planning
    with a neural network, for use in hybrid control of quadruped robots.
  \item Demonstration that the proposed planner can generate dynamic,
    acyclic gaits in challenging environments.
  \item Empirical evaluation showing that the planner achieves
    comparable diverse expressiveness with fast inference times.
\end{itemize}
