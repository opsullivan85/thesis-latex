Quadruped locomotion in unstructured environments demands footstep
planners that combine adaptability, computational efficiency, and
physical consistency. This thesis addresses the challenge of
generating dynamic, acyclic contact sequences by exploring a hybrid
control framework that integrates a greedy, neural network-based
footstep planner—GaitNet—within a traditional model-based controller.
Building on insights from recent learning-driven approaches while
maintaining the reliability of structured control, this work aims to
close the gap between flexible footstep selection and stable
trajectory execution. The following contributions summarize the
central advances introduced in this thesis:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Development of a novel footstep planner utilizing greedy planning
    with a neural network, for use in hybrid control of quadruped robots.
  \item Demonstration that the proposed planner can generate dynamic,
    acyclic gaits in challenging environments.
  \item \hl{Empirical} evaluation showing that the planner achieves
    comparable diverse expressiveness with fast inference times.
\end{itemize}
