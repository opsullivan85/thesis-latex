\section{Contributions}

\begin{outline}
  Outline the key contributions of your work, such as the novel
  greedy, CNN-based planner for multi-leg footstep actions and its
  evaluation against existing methods.
\end{outline}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Development of a novel footstep planner utilizing greedy planning
    with a neural network, for use in hybrid control of quadruped robots.
  \item Demonstration that the proposed planner can generate dynamic,
    acyclic gaits in challenging environments.
  \item Empirical evaluation showing that the planner achieves
    comparable diverse expressiveness with fast inference times.
\end{itemize}
