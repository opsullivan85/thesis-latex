\section{Hypothesis}

In order to fill in the identified research gap, we hypothesize that
a hybrid control pipeline that incorporates a greedy, neural network-based
footstep planner can effectively generate dynamic, non-gaited locomotion
for quadruped robots in challenging. By leveraging the advancements
made by ContactNet and extending its capabilities to support multi-leg
actions, we believe that such a planner can produce footstep sequences
that enable the robot to navigate complex terrains while maintaining
stability and efficiency.

The proposed approach will utilize a modified implementation of
ContactNet's architecture, adapting it for the purpose of generating
footstep candidates. These footstep candidates will then be ranked by
a novel planner, GaitNet, in order to select the most suitable action
at every point in time. By integrating this planner into a traditional
control pipeline, we aim to combine the strengths of both learning-based
and classical methods, resulting in a robust and adaptable quadruped
locomotion system.
