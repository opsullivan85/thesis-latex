\section{Hypothesis}
\label{sec:introduction-hypothesis}

To address the identified research gap, we hypothesize that a hybrid
control pipeline, incorporating a greedy, neural network-based
footstep planner and a traditional model-based control framework, can
effectively generate dynamic, non-gaited locomotion for quadruped
robots in challenging environments. By leveraging the advancements
introduced by ContactNet and extending its capabilities to support
multi-leg motion with dynamic swing durations, we beleive that such a
planner can produce footstep sequences that enable the robot to
traverse complex terrains while maintaining both stability and efficiency.
