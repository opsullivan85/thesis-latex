\section{Hypothesis}

To address the identified research gap, we hypothesize that a hybrid
control pipeline incorporating a greedy, neural network-based
footstep planner can effectively generate dynamic, non-gaited
locomotion for quadruped robots in challenging environments. By
leveraging the advancements introduced by ContactNet and extending
its capabilities to support multi-leg actions, we propose that such a
planner can produce footstep sequences that enable the robot to
traverse complex terrains while maintaining both stability and efficiency.

The proposed approach employs a modified implementation of
ContactNet's architecture, adapted specifically to generate footstep
candidates. These candidates will be evaluated and ranked by a novel
planner, \textit{GaitNet}, which selects the most appropriate action
at each time step. By integrating this planner within a traditional
control framework, we aim to harness the advantages of both
learning-based and model-based methods, yielding a robust and
adaptable quadruped locomotion system.
