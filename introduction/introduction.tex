\chapter{Introduction}

Quadruped locomotion in unstructured environments remains a complex
challenge, particularly when traditional gait cycles are
insufficient. While many systems rely on periodic gait patterns or
centralized planners, recent advances in learning-based methods have
opened the door to more adaptive, non-gaited approaches. This
proposal investigates a novel method for generating non-gaited,
dynamic footstep plans using a CNN-based greedy planner, aiming for a
balance between computational efficiency and dynamic behaviors.
