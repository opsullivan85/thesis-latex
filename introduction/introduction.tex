\chapter{Introduction}

Quadruped locomotion in unstructured environments remains a
significant challenge, particularly when traditional gait cycles
prove inadequate \cite{Chai2022survey}. While many existing systems
rely on periodic gait
patterns or centralized planners \cite{Chai2022survey}, recent
advances in learning-based
methods have enabled more adaptive, non-gaited approaches
\cite{Fan2024survey}. This study
proposes a novel method for generating non-gaited, dynamic footstep
plans using a neural network-based greedy planner, aiming to achieve
a balance between computational efficiency and dynamic performance.
