\section{Research Question}

\begin{outline}
  State your core research question as presented in the proposal:
  "Can a greedy, CNN-based planner match the expressiveness of tree
  search while improving runtime for dynamic, non-gaited locomotion?"
\end{outline}

\begin{emphasis}
  Can a machine learning planner generate dynamic, acyclic gaits for
  quadruped robots in challenging environments?
\end{emphasis}
