\section{Action Cost Ablation Study}
\label{sec:action-cost-ablation-study}

\begin{todo}\\
  explore the correlation between logits and candidate action costs
  \begin{itemize}
    \item starts off very high 0.8, drops to 0.4 during training
    \item compare training time and final performance of a model
      trained with and without the action cost in the reward function
    \item hypothesis: The action cost is useful at the beginning of
      training to help the model quickly learn the robot dynamics.
    \item note: if the action cost and logits are very poorly
      correlated, then there is possible improvement in the candidate
      action sampling method.
  \end{itemize}
\end{todo}
