\section{Baseline Comparison}

\begin{todo}\\
  compare performance of ContactNet vs baseline
  \begin{itemize}
    \item baseline is ContactNet style locomotion with one swing at a time
    \item evaluate on terrains with different obstacle densities
    \item show the performance vs control speed
    \item performance is measured as the failure rate over N trials
  \end{itemize}
\end{todo}
