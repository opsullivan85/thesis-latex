\section{Footstep Evaluation Network}
\label{sec:results-footstep-evaluation-network}

The results of the footstep evaluation network are highly promising,
with the model able to predict footstep candidate maps with strong
accuracy. As a brief recap, the cost maps visualize a set of footstep
candidates $\mathbf f_c$, which show the heuristic cost of moving
legs to different positions from an initial state.
\autoref{fig:data-cn-typical-comparison} shows the model
output alongside the ground truth for a typical data sample. There
are some very minor differences between the ground truth and model
generated cost maps, but the model is capable of correctly
identifying the general low-cost regions (darker). Notice how the
ground truth generally has the lowest cost regions at $y=0$ and
$x=\pm0.07$ depending on the side of the leg, and the model generated
cost map identifies the lowest cost areas as being in generally the same places.

\autoref{fig:data-cn-challenging-comparison} illustrates a
particularly challenging sample, in which the model still
successfully identifies the most suitable positions for each leg.
Notably, the rear left leg must be positioned far from its nominal
location to maintain stability in this scenario, and the model
correctly predicts this adjustment.

\subsection{Discussion}

The footstep evaluation network effectively samples the continuous
action space, providing diverse and feasible footstep candidates to
GaitNet. In the context of this work, the precise accuracy of the
model is not critical. Its primary role is to sample the continuous
space of foot positions to generate candidate actions for the GaitNet
policy, so the most important aspect is correctly identifying the
general lowest cost regions to move the foot to.

While not perfectly accurate in all scenarios, the network's ability
to identify suitable foothold regions\textemdash even in challenging
configurations as seen in
\autoref{fig:data-cn-challenging-comparison}\textemdash validates its
role as a candidate generator rather than a precise predictor. When
comparing the generated figures to the ground truth, the most
important observation is that the darkest region of each sub-plot is
in roughly the correct area. The results indicate that the footstep
evaluation network is suitable for generating footstep candidates.
