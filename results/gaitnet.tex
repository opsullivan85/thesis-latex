\section{GaitNet}
\label{sec:results-gaitnet}

The primary objective of GaitNet is to generate fully dynamic and
acyclic gaits for quadruped robots. An example swing sequence is
shown in \autoref{fig:data-swing-schedule}, illustrating a
non-repetitive, dynamic gait in which the robot performs motions with
up to two feet off the ground simultaneously. Swing durations are
non-uniform, with some legs remaining in the swing phase longer than
others. These results demonstrate that the system can synthesize a
wide variety of actions, which are analyzed further below.

Examining \autoref{fig:data-swing-schedule}, a short step is observed
for the front-left leg (green) at 3\,s, while the rear-right leg
(red) executes a longer step at 5\,s. Although the differences in
duration are subtle, they indicate that the system is capable of
dynamically varying step timing.

Another important observation from \autoref{fig:data-swing-schedule}
is the system's response to changing control inputs. Between
0--7.5\,s, the robot is commanded to follow a slow input, and the
system takes a cautious approach, moving one foot at a time. After
7.5\,s, the input speed increases, prompting a more dynamic gait.
During this faster phase, the robot occasionally executes two steps
simultaneously and does not follow a strict alternating pattern,
further highlighting the system's flexibility in generating acyclic gaits.

To ensure the consistency of the training process, GaitNet was
trained three times. Due to computational limitations, the 700-step
training curriculum needed to be split into multiple runs. The runs
were typically 350 steps long. This has the side effect of resetting
the distribution of terrain levels, which can cause discontinuities
in certain training metrics.

The mean episode reward during training is shown in
\autoref{fig:data-training-mean-reward}. Each training instance shows a
similar trend, with the reward increasing as the model learns to
navigate the terrain.

Another important metric is the mean steps per second. Initially,
with limited training, the model moves its legs very frequently,
leading to unstable motion. In initial experiments, it was found that
this issue does not resolve well without guidance from the reward function.
\autoref{sec:appendix-reward-function-analysis} provides more detail
on this issue, but the results are shown in
\autoref{fig:data-training-steps-per-second}. The mean steps per second
starts high and decreases as the model learns to take more stable steps.

During training, the GaitNet model learns to adjust swing durations
based on its input, as illustrated in
\autoref{fig:data-duration-mean} and \autoref{fig:data-duration-std}.
The mean swing duration settles to \resGaitNetMeanSwingDuration with
a standard deviation of \resGaitNetSTDSwingDuration, indicating that
the model uses a wide range of its allowable swing durations. These
figures highlight how the model learns to effectively utilize dynamic
swing durations to adapt to varying conditions.

A histogram of swing durations selected by GaitNet is shown in
\autoref{fig:data-swing-duration-histogram}. This data was collected
in the experiments described in
\autoref{sec:results-baseline-comparison}. The distribution shows
that GaitNet effectively optimizes the swing duration from the
nominal value of 0.2\,s.
