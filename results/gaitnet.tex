\section{GaitNet}

The primary goal of GaitNet is to generate fully dynamic and acyclic
gaits for quadruped robots. An example swing sequence can be seen in
\autoref{fig:data-swing-schedule}. The figure clearly shows an acyclic
gait, in that it is non-repetitive, and dynamic gait, in that the robot
performs dynamically unstable motions with up to two feet off of the ground.
Additionally, the swing durations are non-uniform, with some legs
swinging for longer than others. It is clear that the system is able to
synthesize a wide variety of actions, the value of which will be evaluated
in this section.
