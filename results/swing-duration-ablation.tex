\section{Swing Duration Ablation Study}
\label{sec:results-swing-ablation-study}

In this section we present an ablation study to assess the impact of
dynamic swing duration on GaitNet's performance. We compare two
models: the standard GaitNet formulation as described in
\autoref{sec:methodology-gaitnet}, and a Duration-Ablated-GaitNet trained
with a fixed swing duration.

During training, the GaitNet model learns to adjust swing durations
based on its input, as illustrated with
\autoref{fig:data-duration-mean} and \autoref{fig:data-duration-std}.
The mean swing duration settles to 0.24\,s with a standard deviation
of 0.034\,s, indicating that the model uses a wide range of its
allowable swing durations. These figures highlight how the model
learns to effectively utilize dynamic swing durations to adapt to
varying conditions.

Furthermore, a histogram of swing durations selected by GaitNet
during training, shown in \autoref{fig:data-duration-histogram},
reveals a broad distribution of values. This indicates that the model
is not biased towards a narrow range of swing durations, but rather
effectively leverages the flexibility provided by dynamic swing
durations to optimize its gait.

Now, we train the Duration-Ablated-GaitNet model, setting the swing
duration to a constant 0.24\,s. The training process is identical to
that of the standard GaitNet model, ensuring a fair comparison. The
performance of both models is then evaluated using the same metrics outlined in
\autoref{sec:results-baseline-comparison}.

    across various terrain difficulties and commanded velocities.
    Overall survival rate of 67.2\%.     Mean success rate measured as
    the percentage of 50 episodes     which completed 20\,s without
    terminating, under the termination   conditions described in
  \autoref{sec:appendix-termination-functions}.}
  \label{fig:data-duration-ablation-comparison}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:data-duration-ablation-comparison} presents the
performance comparison between the standard GaitNet and the
duration-ablated variant. The results indicate that the standard
GaitNet outperforms the duration-ablated model across a range of
terrain difficulties and commanded velocities. This demonstrates the
effectiveness of dynamic swing duration in enhancing GaitNet's
ability to adapt to varying conditions and generate robust gaits.
